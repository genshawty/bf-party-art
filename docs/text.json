    "faq": "How to get into Discord?\n\t-Try to catch the links in twitter, visit AMAs in different servers and alpha groups and get link from there\n\nHow to purchase the NFT?\n\t-Buy it from presale or public sale (TBD) or from secondary market after the mint\n\nHow to get into the whitelist?\n\t-Ping wurby in the #general and ask him to stay hydrated/say FLG and WAGMI (shame).\n\tBetter choice will be being active in text-chats, voice chats and iteract with BF Party twitter. Also you can participate in different events and have a chance to win presale role there!\n"
